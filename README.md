# XGBregression_Forecast_Traffic_Docker_Part2 (This project is still in progress as of 9 March 2020. Will be back to update this ReadMe)
Part2 of my project uses wep app (built using Flask, HTML and CSS) to take in User's input. Traffic Forecast will be made by using the User's input and running it through a saved pre-trained XGBRegression Model. The forecasted traffic and its parameters will then be displayed to the user. 

The wep app has other features such as account creation/reset/profile creation..., update of user's input and many more. 

To give credit where credit is due, most of the Flask/HTML/CSS code came from the tutorial from Corey Schafer (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo&list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH). Much Thanks to Corey Schafer for his effort!
